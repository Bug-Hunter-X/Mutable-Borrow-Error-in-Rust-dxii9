This repository demonstrates a common error in Rust: having multiple mutable references to the same variable. The `bug.rs` file contains the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.rs` presents a corrected version.  The error arises from violating Rust's borrowing rules, leading to a compile-time error.  The solution illustrates how to restructure the code to avoid the conflict by using a single mutable reference at a time.
